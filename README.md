# 👋 Hi, I’m Nguyen Van Quang

I’m currently the **COO of H&C TECHNOLOGY., JSC**, with **over 4 years of experience in product management and product development**, working closely with both technical and business teams.

In parallel, I’m also the **Founder of PawPam World**, an indie project that started from a small pixel-style game and is gradually expanding into mobile applications, backend systems, solutions, and AI productions.

From a technical perspective, I’ve worked with **Python, Java, and PHP**, and I’ve been directly involved in **building and scaling real-world products**, from early-stage ideas to execution and deployment. I’m especially interested in how **technology and product strategy come together in early-stage startups**.
